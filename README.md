## Linux Commands
As a software developer, it is important to know Linux commands for several reasons. Having a strong understanding of Linux commands is crucial for software developers, as it can improve productivity, debugging abilities, and collaboration, while also allowing them to manage servers and version control systems more effectively.
Listed below are the top 12 commands I personally feel are most useful:
### 1. curl
This command is used for sending and receiving data over the internet, such as sending HTTP requests or downloading files. It is useful for testing and interacting with web services and APIs.
### 2. rsync
This command is used for synchronizing files and directories between systems. It is useful for backing up files and for transferring large amounts of data efficiently.
### 3. ssh-keygen
This command is used for generating and managing SSH keys, which are used for secure remote access to systems. It is useful for setting up secure access to remote servers and for managing multiple keys.
### 4. head and tail

### 9. ctags
This is a code tagging tool that generates an index of function definitions and variables within a code base, making it easier to navigate and understand the code.
### 10. gdb
This is a debugging tool used for debugging and analyzing program crashes. It provides information about the cause of a crash, the state of the program at the time of the crash, and the values of variables.
### 11. strace
This is a debugging tool used for tracing system calls and signals made by a process. It is useful for identifying the cause of errors and finding potential performance issues.
### 12. ssh
